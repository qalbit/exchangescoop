```
To use the bindings, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading):

## Getting Started
Simple example looks like:
```php
$scoop = new Exchange("YOUR_EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY");

// Set base currency
$scoop->setBaseCurrency("AUD");

// Get latest exchange rate
$exchange_rates = $scoop->getLatestExchangeRate();
print_r($exchange_rates);
```

Convert currency
```php
// Convert your currency
$target_currency = "USD";
$amount_to_convert = 100;
$converted_amount = $scoop->convert($target_currency, $amount_to_convert);
print_r($converted_amount);
```
